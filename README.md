JSON Formatter [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/frankbille/jsonformatter.png)](http://travis-ci.org/frankbille/jsonformatter)
==============

Very simple JSON formatter, which can help in determining why a JSON file is invalid.

When dealing with very large JSON files, it is easy to get lost in them and difficult
to find mistakes. With this tool you can format a JSON file, even if it is not well-formed,
and look at the output in a text editor, to see wrongly formatted lines. This will
be an indication of that something is wrong.
